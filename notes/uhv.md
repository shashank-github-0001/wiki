## define self exploration what is content of self exploration

Self exploration is the process to find out what is valuable to me by investigating within myself. What is
right for me and true for me has to be judged within myself. Once we start paying attention towards
investigating into our present beliefs and aspirations, we get to know whether our aspirations and what
we really want to be (i.e. what is naturally acceptable to us) are one and the same or not. If they are the
same, then itâ€™s no problem. But if the two are different, it means that we are leading a life against our
natural acceptance. Such a life cannot bring us happiness.
Self exploration is a process of discovering that there is something innate, invariant and universal in all
human beings. This enables us to look at the confusions and contradictions within us and resolve them
by becoming aware of our natural acceptance. Once we start observing inside, we can achieve harmony
at all levels of our living
