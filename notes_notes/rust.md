### important things that i need to learn
* const cannot be mutated
* shadowing
* static { int, float, bool, char} compound types {}
* tuples can be compound types

## what does cargo do
* cargo new to create a src directory and Cargo.toml file
* cargo build to produce an executable in the target/debug/
* cargo run to both build and run the executable
* cargo check to check if it compiles without building the executable
* there is cargo build --release which is optimized but takes time to build
